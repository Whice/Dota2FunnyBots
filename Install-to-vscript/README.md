## Developer notes

1. Sometimes player wants to install this script to the steam bot local dev folder to resolve some issues, for example bots may fail to load correctly in some conditions.
1. For players to easily install the script into the correct location without any technical reqiurements, I created these scripts to provide a simple installation experience.
1. There are currently 3 files in this folder:
    1. `quick-install-oha.bat`: Directly runnable script, written texts in `English`.
    1. `quick-install-oha-cn.bat`: Directly runnable script, written texts in `Chinese`.
    1. `quick-install-oha-mac.sh`: Executable script for Mac, written texts in `English`.

## Usage, Windows

1. In Dota2, subscribe to the bot script "Open Hyper AI", make sure to wait for the script be fully downloaded.
1. Go to folder: `Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\3246316298\Install-to-vscript`, and double click the file `quick-install-oha.bat` to install.
1. Double click on the `quick-install-oha.bat` file to finish installation.
1. If you don't know where the Steam folder is, right click `Dota2` in Steam `Library`, select `Properties` > `Installed Files` > `Browse`. It will open the folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta`, now replace the path text `common\dota 2 beta` in the address to be `workshop\content\570\3246316298\Install-to-vscript`, hit Enter to open the correct folder.

## Usage, Mac

1. Open a terminal.
1. Navigate to the directory (`Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\3246316298\Install-to-vscript`) containing the script.
1. Run `chmod +x quick-install-oha-mac.sh` to make it executable.
1. Execute it with `sudo ./quick-install-oha-mac.sh` to ensure sufficient permissions.

By doing this, any new updates to the script content will automatically available as your Local dev script. Alternatively, you can choose to create a symbolic link yourself, check out Appendix below.
